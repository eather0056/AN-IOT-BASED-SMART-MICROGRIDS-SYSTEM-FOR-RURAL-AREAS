# AN-IOT-BASED-SMART-MICROGRIDS-SYSTEM-FOR-RURAL-AREAS

## Abstract

To enhance living conditions and alleviate poverty, emerging nations require energy services that are dependable, accessible, safe, and efficient. This research study proposes an IoT-based smart microgrid system for rural areas with an enhanced control system for efficient microgrid operation, which may, in turn, solve multiple issues in rural areas.

The proposed system is a combination of solar and wind power generators, diesel power stations, and backup storage. It has the functionality of detecting instantaneous faults in the microgrid branches using the Bewlice lattice diagram and support vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, it can be controlled remotely over the internet at any moment. 

A power monitoring system is integrated to provide authorities with technical attributes related to energy. These attributes can be utilized to supply power to rural areas in emergencies through an Android Application. The data can be retrieved and displayed using a cloud platform named ThingSpeak.
